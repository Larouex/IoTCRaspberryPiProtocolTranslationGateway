# Raspberry Pi "Protocol Translation" Gateway for Azure IoT Central

![alt text](./Assets/raspberry-pi-4-hero-shot.png "Project Hero Shot") 

## Overview
This repository is part of a training and project series for Azure IoT Central. The name of the series is "Raspberry Pi Gateway and Arduino Nano BLE Devices for Azure Iot Central" and is located at...

[LINK: Training & Project Site for Raspberry Pi Gateway and Arduino Nano BLE Devices for Azure Iot Central](http://www.hackinmakin.com/Raspberry%20Pi%20Gateway%20and%20BLE/index.html)

This project will enable a Raspberry Pi to act as a "Protocol Translation" Gateway connected to Azure IoT Central and send Telemerty on behalf of of the Devices we have created for this project. You should go back and create the Nano BLE Devices if you landed here out of sequence.

## Setting up Your Development Toolchain
The code in this repository depends on Ardunio, Visual Studio Code and PlatformIO.

### Your Local Machine
The development "toolchain" refers to all of the various tools, SDK's and bits we need to install on your machine to facilitate a smooth experience developing our BLE devices and the Raspberry Pi Gateway device. Our main development tool will be Visual Studio code. It has dependencies on tools from Arduino and other open source projects, but it will be the central place where all our development will occur making it easy to follow along  regardless of which operating system you are working on.

| - | Install These Tools |
|---|---|
| ![Python](./Assets/python-icon-100.png) | [LINK: Python 3 Installation Page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - Pyhon is the programming language we will use to build applications for the Raspberry Pi. |
| ![Visual Studio Code](./Assets/vs-code-icon-100.png) | [LINK: Visual Studio Code Installation Page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) - Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. This is the IDE we will use to write code and deploy to the our BLE Devices and the Raspberry Pi Gateway.  |
| ![PlatformIO](./Assets/platformio-icon-100.png) | [LINK: PlatformIO VS Code Install](https://platformio.org/platformio-ide) - PlatformIO is a cross-platform, cross-architecture, multiple framework, professional tool for embedded systems engineers and for software developers who write applications for embedded products. It works seamlessly with Visual Studio Code. |

Assuming everything is installed and working, Open Visual Studio Code and open the folder you cloned this repository into. You should see:

## Setup the Development Toolchain

### Install Git
Git is the tool we use for version control and management of software assets. Our workshop will use it to clone the modules and also to save anything if you want

[LINK: Git Installation Page](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

### Install Visual Studio Code
This is the IDE we will use to write code, deploy to the RPi, etc. 

[LINK: Visual Studio Code Installation Page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

### Install Python
Pyhon is the programming language we will use to build applications for the Raspberry Pi

From the Python Org: 
* Python is powerful... and fast;
* plays well with others; 
* runs everywhere; 
* is friendly & easy to learn; 
* is Open.

[LINK: Python 3 Installation Page](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Upgrading pip
Pip is the package manager we will use to download packages

On Linux or macOS (Open Terminal):
```
    pip install -U pip
```
On Windows (from a CMD window or Powershell):
```
    python -m pip install -U pip
```

### Install all the Tools for Visual Studio Code
These are a set of tools we will use to develop our apps on the Raspberry Pi. You can open the Extensions sidebar with "Shift+Ctrl+X) or click the icon in the side navigator bar.
